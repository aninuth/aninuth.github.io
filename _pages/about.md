Hello! My name is Ani and I'm not sure what I should put on here. I know I should have a website, though! I promise I have a lot of thoughts, and some of them are interesting.

Fun Stuff

I like to read, cook, play sports (currently getting *really* into pickleball). I am a volunteer football coach at St. Louis Park High School.
