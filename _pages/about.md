Hi there! I'm Ani, a recent graduate of the University of Minnesota with an M.S. in Computer Science (ML Emphasis). I also earned my undergraduate degree at the U of M, with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Math and Neuroscience. My master's project, which was published as a paper, focused on using Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide interactive visualizations and explanations for users to better understand SHAPley values. Previously, my research centered on using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning to extract clinically relevant information from intracranial EEG data in patients with epilepsy.

When I'm not diving into data, I love to cook, read (everything from novels and blogs to academic articles and textbooks), and spend time outside. I've recently gotten really into pickleball, and as a Minnesotan transplant, I can never pass up the opportunity to go for a lake swim. I'm passionate about a lot of things, but I'm most motivated by learning something new and making people smile.
